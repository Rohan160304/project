/**
 * MemberBottomNav — the five primary destinations from the spec:
 * Home · Feed · Offers · Explore · Profile.
 *
 * The panel previously had only a 25-link desktop sidebar, which is the wrong
 * shape for a mobile-first product: the five things a member actually does were
 * buried among twenty others. The sidebar remains on desktop, where there is
 * room for the full directory; on phones this is the primary navigation.
 *
 * Each tab owns a section of the app, so a tab stays lit for any route beneath
 * it — Explore is still current when you are three levels into a temple.
